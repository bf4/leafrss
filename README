NAME

	LeafRSS - a learning filtered RSS aggregator
	
DESCRIPTION

	LeafRSS is a learning filtered RSS aggregator. It is designed to filter out
	unwanted aricles from several feeds and display them through a web interface.
	It also caches the feeds in a user-defined database. Currently only MySQL is
	supported.
	
	LeafRSS has been tested using PHP 4.x, but should work without incident in PHP
	5, as an effort has been made to make this as non-version-specific as 
	possible.
	
	LeafRSS makes extensive use of LastRSS for feed parsing. The latest copy of
	LastRSS can be found at http://lastrss.oslab.net/. They also provide
	documentation for LastRSS. LeafRSS currently uses LastRSS version 0.9.1, and
	has not been tested with any other versions. A copy of LastRSS v0.9.1 is
	included with LeafRSS.
	
	As of LeafRSS 1.1, we have included a version of PHPlot for the Bayes
	statistics graphs. The latest version of PHPlot can be found at 
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplot/. They also provide documentation for
	PHPlot. LeafRSS currently uses PHPlot version 5.0.5, and has not been tested
	with any other versions.


GETTING STARTED
	
	Extract the downloaded file into the desired web directory. In order for 
	LeafRSS to run properly, the user account that runs your web server (i.e. 
	www-data) must have write access to this directory. You must also either have 
	an available database already created for the install script to create tables 
	in, or create a new database manually. LeafRSS will not create databases on 
	its own to prevent permission problems on public servers. Be sure that 
	whichever database user you are using for LeafRSS has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, 
	CREATE, and ALTER permissions for the selected database or the install script 
	will not run correctly. Once all this is set, run install.php in the root of
	the install folder. This will create the configuration file, the required 
	tables in the database, and set some default values for some of the global 
	variables stored in the database.

USING CRON FOR UPDATES

	As of version 0.4, you can now either use an internal update timer or cron (or
	similar scheduler) to update the feeds. This option is selectable at install,
	and can be changed via the global settings editor. NOTE THAT TURNING ON CRON
	IN THE SETTINGS WILL NOT CREATE A CRON JOB FOR YOU, IT WILL SIMPLY DISABLE THE
	INTERNAL TIMER! To create a cron job, add something like the following line to
	your crontab:
	
	@hourly php4 /path/to/leafrss/update.php
	
	For more information on cron and crontab, check the man pages for cron.

AUTHENTICATION ISSUES

	As of 0.7 you now have the option to select the method for authenticating to 
	access the administration area. The system defaults to session-based login, as
	there were some issues discovered using the 0.6 and earlier method of browser-
	based authentication (via WWW-Authenticate headers). You can switch between
	the two methods now, but be warned that changing this setting may require you 
	to log in again.

TIME ZONE SETTINGS

	As of 0.8 there is the option in the global settings to set your time
	difference from GMT, which will alter the publish date shown on the front end 
	to match your time zone. It defaults to 0 (which is GMT), and can be set from
	-12 to 12 (i.e. PST is GMT -7, so set to -7 if in Pacific Standard Time)
	
SMARTY TEMPLATES

	As of 0.9 we have integrated Smarty template capabilities into LeafRSS to
	allow greater ease of layout customization without the worry of breaking the
	functionality of the filter. We have included a copy of Smarty 2.6.16 with
	this release, and the defaults within the config file point to the included
	copy of Smarty. If you already have Smarty installed on your server, then
	simply update the Smarty variables in your config.inc file to point to your
	installed copy. Note that we have not tested LeafRSS with versions earlier
	than 2.6.16, so we cannot guarantee that your copy of Smarty will be fully
	compatible if you are using an earlier version.
	
	LeafRSS will attempt to create the Smarty compile directory specified in the
	config.inc file. If your server does not give the web user the permissions
	required to create the smarty compile directory, the script will not run. If
	this occurs, you will need to create the directory manually and give the user
	that the web server runs under write permissions to that directory.
	
	For more information on Smarty, please visit http://smarty.php.net/. Special
	thanks to all the folks at Smarty for their hard work!
	
PATCHING AN OLD VERSION

	Starting with version 0.6, there will be a patch file available to upgrade
	from the previous version. Please read the PATCH file for details.
